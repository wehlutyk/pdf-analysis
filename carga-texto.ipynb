Rather, such\\nattention is typically described as a symptom of reactive\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98bottom-up\\xe2\\x80\\x99 emotional response (e.g., [11,12]).\\nIn this Opinion article we synthesize basic research on\\nvisual selective attention, clinical research on attentional\\nbiases in anxiety and depression, and research in affective\\nscience to support our proposal that affect-biased attention\\nis a form of emotion regulation. This proposal is framed\\nwithin the context of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Extended Model of Emotion\\nRegulation\\xe2\\x80\\x99, a comprehensive model that is grounded in\\ndevelopmental research and integrates models and findings from cognitive and affective neuroscience within a\\ndynamic view of cognition/emotion processes (Box 1 and\\nFigure 1). \\xe2\\x80\\x98Affect-biased attention\\xe2\\x80\\x99 refers to a pre-tuning of\\nsensory systems so that certain categories of affectively\\nsalient stimuli are perceived over others. Here, we emphasize the regulatory role that affect-biased attention plays\\nbefore the occurrence of an emotionally arousing event. For\\nexample, by biasing perception towards certain types of\\npositive or negative stimuli, habitual affect-biased attention may modulate emotional responses to stressful events\\n(see also [13]). Thus, if one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visual filters are pre-tuned to\\nsee more happy faces relative to angry faces in a crowd, one\\nmay be less likely to experience feelings of negative affect\\nand heightened physiological arousal in a stressful situation than if one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention is habitually biased towards\\nnegative expressions. Moreover, following classic work by\\nBruner [14], we argue that such habitual antecedent\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences July 2012, Vol. 16, No. 7\\n\\ntuning of attention to context-specific and emotionally\\nsalient features of the environment is strongly shaped\\nby development. In short, affect-biased attention consists\\nin the implicit filtering processes, tuned over past experience, that modulate emotional responses to the world.\\nA recent definition of emotion regulation stipulates that\\na process is regulatory \\xe2\\x80\\x98if and only if it is instantiated in\\npursuit of a goal to influence an ongoing or future emotion\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n[2]. Given that affect-biased attention is deployed habitually with the ongoing goal of modulating a habitually\\nanticipated emotion (e.g., anxiety), it is regulatory in precisely this way. Nevertheless, from a dynamic perspective\\nthat emphasizes the ongoing unfolding of cognitive/emotional processes [15\\xe2\\x80\\x9317], \\xe2\\x80\\x98emotion regulation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is not a\\nprocess in its own right, but a useful heuristic, one that\\nhelps to delineate a taxonomy of cognition-emotion subcomponents [2]. Affect-biased attention is one of these\\nsubcomponents that modulate emotional responses at multiple temporal scales. When the full range of processes and\\ntheir subcomponents is taken into consideration, however,\\nit may prove difficult to define the boundary between\\nemotion and regulation. For this reason, as several prominent emotion researchers have recently claimed [18,19],\\nattempting to distinguish between emotion and its regulation may ultimately be impossible.\\nBiased attention to affectively salient events\\nLike emotion regulation, attentional selection is a broad\\ncategory that includes a number of component processes.\\nFor example, attention can be deployed before or after an\\n\\nBox 1. Extended model of emotion regulation\\nThe extended model of emotion regulation (EMER) is a synthetic\\nmodel, drawing on developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, which is contextualized within a dynamic view of cognition/emotion processes in the brain [15]. Drawing on Gross\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ninfluential process model [2], we divide emotion regulation strategies\\ninto those that modulate emotional responses either before or after\\nan emotionally salient event (Figure 1, x axis). However, distinct from\\ndual-process models that draw a line between conscious and\\nunconscious processes, or propose distinct neural pathways for each\\n[8,32], we draw on developmental research to incorporate the notion\\nof multiple levels of control processes [47]. Drawing on Eisenberg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nnotion of levels of reactive and effortful control, we suggest that these\\nrange from reflexive strategies to more cognitively \\xe2\\x80\\x98effortful\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ones\\n(Figure 1, y axis). These are based on graded levels of awareness/\\navailability for reflection, subserved by increasingly elaborated levels\\nof processing [3,70].\\nMore effortful strategies become available with cognitive development, as levels of regulatory strategy become increasingly sophisticated, moving from limited stimulus-bound and temporally\\nimmediate responses to more deliberate and flexible strategies\\naimed at temporally distant goals [31]. To a certain extent, each level\\nof regulatory skill is thought to be dependent on development of the\\nprevious level. Specific regulatory strategies range from shifting\\nattention away from a distressing object or event (e.g., [10]) and\\naction tendencies to approach or withdraw, which emerge in infancy,\\nto suppression of behaviors associated with approach, avoidance, or\\nemotional display, which can be observed in toddlerhood [9]. Further\\nskills, such as postponing immediate gratification for a more distant\\ngoal, emerge with cognitive milestones achieved in early childhood.\\nOthers, such as reinterpretation or reappraisal of events in order to\\nmodify one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emotional response [1], rumination [8], and coping\\nstrategies such as problem-solving [71] rely on cognitive capacities\\nthat continue to mature into adolescence. The affect-biased attention\\n366\\n\\nwe focus on here is one of a number of attentional deployment\\nstrategies, although it is one that is typically not discussed in terms of\\nits regulatory role. Affect-biased attention may be sculpted gradually\\nfrom infancy onward, although it may also be retrained by changing\\ndevelopmental or situational contexts.\\nOnce available, more effortful and explicit strategies can be\\nemployed at a habitual level when primed in the laboratory or by a\\nsituational context, either prior or subsequent to an emotional event.\\nFor example, Mauss and colleagues [6] found that participants who\\nwere primed with words that evoked control rather than suppression\\nof emotion were less likely to experience feelings of anger after anger\\ninduction. Williams and colleagues further found that priming\\nparticipants with reappraisal goals reduced heart rate responses to\\nan anxiety-inducing emotional challenge [7], suggesting that highorder strategies can be primed without reported awareness. However,\\nwe suggest that such high-order strategies as reappraisal may be\\npossible only once the capacity for explicit re-appraisal is developmentally available.\\nAccording to the extended model, emotional interpretations\\ninvolve the continuous unfolding of dynamical cognition-emotion\\ninteractions implicated in evaluation of events and regulation of\\nresponses to them at both psychological and neuronal levels [15]. In\\nreal time, over milliseconds to minutes, and in developmental time,\\nover the course of years, increasingly effortful strategies draw on\\ncycles of reprocessing of evaluative information into more complex\\nhierarchical networks [72]. Information gleaned from initial rapid\\nevaluations and habitual responses can be subsequently reprocessed\\nat more reflective and effortful levels [72]. More reflective processing\\nthen feeds back to tune more reflexive perceptual filters and affective\\nappraisals. Thus, according to this model, affect-biased attention, as a\\nrapid, reflexive antecedent process of evaluation-based filtering,\\ncontinuously shapes and is shaped by more reflective strategies\\nwithin an emotional interpretation.\\n\\n\\x0cOpinion\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences July 2012, Vol. 16, No. 7\\n\\nEffortful\\n\\nReappraisal\\n(antecedent\\ncognitive\\nevaluation)\\n\\nTime\\n\\nAvoidance\\n\\nPrior to event\\n\\nAvoidance\\n\\nD\\ne\\nv\\ne\\nl\\no\\np\\nm\\ne\\nn\\nt\\n\\nAwareness/Effort\\n\\nAnticipatory coping\\nstrategies\\nReappraisal\\n(retrospective\\ncognitive\\nevaluation)\\nAttention deployment: distraction\\nSuppression/overriding action tendencies\\nSubsequent to event\\nPrimed reappraisal\\nPrimed ER goals\\n\\nAction tendencies to approach/withdraw\\n\\nAffect-biased attention\\n\\nReflexive\\nTRENDS in Cognitive Sciences\\n\\nFigure 1.

The x axis represents time prior to and subsequent to an emotionally arousing event (time 0) and the y axis represents the\\nrange of regulatory processes from habitual to effortful. Example regulatory processes are indicated with filled circles. Affect-biased attention, in yellow, is an antecedent\\nand reflexive form of emotion regulation involving visual selective attention that tunes the contents of what we \\xe2\\x80\\x98see\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the first place, before we encounter it.\\n\\nevent and can involve rapid or more extended processes,\\nranging from antecedent biasing of attention via control\\nsettings, to subsequent engagement of attention by stimulus salience, to later ease or difficulty of disengagement\\nwhen an attentional shift is demanded [20]. Here, we\\ndiscuss affect-biased attention as a specific form of selective attention that, unlike other attentional processes, has\\nbeen typically discussed as a reactive symptom of emotion\\nrather than a regulatory strategy [11].\\nSelective visual attention to some aspects of the environment at the expense of others is usually defined in\\nterms of \\xe2\\x80\\x98bottom-up\\xe2\\x80\\x99 versus \\xe2\\x80\\x98top-down\\xe2\\x80\\x99 processes. Bottomup processes involve rapid and relatively reflexive attentional selection based on low-level visual features, intrinsic\\nto the stimulus, such as color, contrast, and motion. Such\\naspects of \\xe2\\x80\\x98objective salience\\xe2\\x80\\x99 command attention because\\nthey are unexpected or stand out from the surrounding\\nenvironment [21,22]. In contrast, effortful, top-down attention [4,23] involves the establishment of \\xe2\\x80\\x98attentional control settings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 [24] \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mental templates that hone attention to\\nspecific object features in the service of immediate goals,\\nsuch as finding one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keys or successfully performing an\\nexperimental task. According to biased-competition models, top-down processes bias attention to relevant features\\nof the environment before stimuli are presented and such\\npre-tuning of filters enhances the subsequent visual processing of those features. At the neural level, frontoparietal\\nattention networks modulate visual cortex activation so\\nthat activity is enhanced in neurons or regions that are\\npreferentially tuned to task-relevant stimuli, whereas activity is suppressed in neurons/regions sensitive to competing stimuli [4,23].\\n\\nBottom-up objective salience is not the only kind of\\nsalience that can capture attention and thereby bias visual\\nprocessing in a relatively reflexive manner. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Affective salience\\xe2\\x80\\x99 engages resources based on the emotional meaning\\nof the stimulus. A robust body of emotion research has\\nestablished that affectively salient stimuli, such as angry\\nor smiling faces, or faces of loved ones are preferentially\\nperceived and remembered when attentional resources are\\nlimited [25\\xe2\\x80\\x9328] and are more likely to attract overt attention when viewing complex scenes [29]. Although rapid\\nbehavioral responses and preferential amygdala activation\\nhave led many researchers in affective science to categorize\\nthem as reactive or bottom-up (e.g., [11]), we and others\\nhave proposed that affective salience mobilizes an alternative top-down system mediated by amygdala-centered networks [30,31,32]. We refer to it as a top-down system,\\nbecause in top-down processes the features of the external\\nenvironment that elicit attention are modulated by plans\\nand goals. Such plans and goals can include affective and\\nmotivational goals [33], although these are not necessarily\\nmodulated by frontoparietal attentional networks.\\nAccording to our affective salience model (following\\n[14]), affective salience networks tune the visual system\\nso that it privileges incoming information based on one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nhistory of experience of what is motivationally relevant in a\\ngiven context, thereby generating a predisposition to attend to certain categories of stimuli over others. This\\npredisposition functions as an \\xe2\\x80\\x98affective control setting\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\nThe result of an affective control setting is the attentional\\ntuning that favors affectively salient stimuli, which we\\ndescribe as affect-biased attention. Because affect-biased\\nattention can be shaped habitually and reflexively, over\\n367\\n\\n\\x0cOpinion\\ntime it can seem reactive or bottom-up-like. This view is\\nconsistent with appraisal models of emotion that stress\\nthat what is salient at any given time may be modulated by\\nappraisals that are reflexive, habitual, and outside of focal\\nattention [19]. These appraisals modulate emotional\\nresponses in the form of inclinations towards action [19].\\nAccording to our model of affect-biased attention, the goals\\nthat shape affect-biased attention are precisely such habitual appraisals of which one is typically unaware. The\\nresult of this kind of regulatory appraisal is affect-biased\\nattentional tuning. Thus, we argue that biases for affective\\ninformation reflect proactive application of affectively\\ntuned top-down templates that are reflexively applied. It\\nis important to note, however, that we are not suggesting\\nthat affect-biased attention to salient laboratory stimuli\\nnecessarily results in a full-blown physiological or experiential emotional response to the stimuli themselves; rather, we suggest that habits of selective attention revealed by\\nlaboratory tasks may influence physiological and experiential responses to more intense life stressors when they\\noccur.\\nAt the neural level, the claim that affective salience\\ninvolves a form of top-down process is supported by findings that amygdala activation modulates visual cortex\\nactivation in a similar manner to visual cortex modulation\\nby frontoparietal networks [28,34]. Thus, the amygdala is\\nan important node in networks that support a form of\\nbiased attention that operates similarly to, but at times\\npartially independent of, the biasing of attention associated with frontoparietal attention networks [35]. Because\\npatterns of amygdala activation serve as well-documented\\nneural markers of preferential responses to stimulus salience, our review of the empirical literature focuses on the\\namygdala; however, it is important to note that other\\nregions, including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the\\npulvinar and inhibitory reticular nuclei of the thalamus,\\nare also important hubs [35\\xe2\\x80\\x9337]. In conjunction with reciprocally connected regions of the amygdala, these regions\\nalso play key roles in integrating information from multiple cortical and subcortical regions to tag stimulus salience\\nand direct attention to preferential features of the environment [35,37].\\nAffect-biased attention may be subserved by \\xe2\\x80\\x98arousalbiased competition\\xe2\\x80\\x99, a mechanism similar to biased competition by top-down networks, in which regions of the\\nvisual cortex show enhanced activation for affectively\\nsalient items at the expense of relatively neutral ones\\n[38]. Recent neuroanatomical research has given rise to\\nneural models that implicate amygdala-thalamic connectivity in rapid orienting of attention to salient locations of\\na scene, thereby accounting for enhanced activation of\\nregions tuned to salient stimuli and inhibition of distractors [35,39]. We suggest that biases in this system towards\\nspecific categories of stimuli underlie affectively biased\\ncompetition. In contrast, more extended network interactions including the OFC are suggested to underlie other\\nattentional processes, such as effortful attentional switching or disengagement [35]. However, there is also evidence\\nthat affective salience may bias attention without suppression of competing stimuli in a manner distinct from\\nbiased competition [40].\\n368\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences July 2012, Vol. 16, No. 7\\n\\nAffective tuning can shift with age and context\\nThe affective salience model emphasizes that amygdala\\ntuning, as a tractable index of motivational salience, is\\nsensitive to both moment-to-moment and developmental\\ncontext. Earlier notions of the amygdala\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role in affective\\nprocessing emphasized the idea that enhanced attention\\nto threat, marked by enhanced amygdala activation, was\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98hard-wired\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in the service of evolutionary goals (e.g., [41]). A\\nmore recent conception is that, rather than being a hardwired \\xe2\\x80\\x98automatic threat detector\\xe2\\x80\\x99, the amygdala functions\\nas a \\xe2\\x80\\x98motivational relevance detector\\xe2\\x80\\x99 [33,42,43]. Our own\\nrecent research suggests that amygdala activation indexing\\naffect-biased attention may shift over the course of minutes\\nwith experimental context and over the course of years with\\ndevelopmental phase.\\nIn a study examining the influence of evaluative goals\\non preferential amygdala activation to positive versus\\nnegative stimuli, Cunningham and colleagues [33] asked\\nparticipants to evaluate the names of famous people. The\\nresults showed that the amygdala responded preferentially to names of celebrities that participants felt positive\\nabout when they were asked to evaluate positivity and to\\nnames of celebrities they felt negative about when asked to\\nrate negativity (Figure 2c,d). Thus, the response pattern of\\nthe amygdala shifted as the affective salience of stimuli\\nchanged according to the moment-to-moment goals of the\\nperceiver. We argue that relative affective salience was\\npre-tuned by task context, allowing the establishment of\\naffect-biased attention to the stimuli that was dependent\\non the task at hand. Such contextual tuning of affective\\nsalience is equivalent to contextual modulation of attention by control settings, consistent with our claim that\\naffect-biased attention functions as a control setting tuned\\nby affective salience. Because of amygdala links to brainstem and hypothalamus regions that modulate subsequent\\nphysiological responses associated with emotional arousal,\\nsuch pre-tuning has the potential to regulate subsequent\\nemotional responses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though preferential amygdala\\nactivation to a stimulus does not necessarily result in a\\ndirect full fledged emotional response.\\nIn another series of studies investigating the role of\\ndevelopmental phase in amygdala response to affective\\nsalience, we showed groups of young children (4-6 years\\nand 6-9 years) and young adults (18-35 years) images of\\ntheir mother and an appearance-matched stranger showing happy and angry/displeased expressions [44]. When\\nfreely viewing the faces, children, but not young adults,\\nshowed greater amygdala activation in response to happy\\nversus angry faces (Figure 2a and b). This finding suggests\\nthat, in contrast to adults, young children may find smiling\\nexpressions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 considered to be rewarding in their own right\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 to be more salient than angry ones. This interpretation is\\nconsistent with a well-documented positivity bias in older\\nadults [45], accompanied by preferential amygdala activation for positive versus negative stimuli [46]. Thus, the\\nrelative salience of positive and negative facial expressions\\nmay be different at different developmental stages, suggesting normative developmental changes in affect-biased\\nattention, or what individuals are predisposed to attend to,\\nwith both young children and older adults showing evidence of a positivity bias relative to young adults.

However,\\nit is important to note that, beyond normative developmental trends, individual differences in specific biases may\\nbecome more entrenched with age [47].\\nAffect-biased attention may also influence downstream\\nregulatory processes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which in turn may show parallel agerelated changes. Some emotional facial expressions are\\nthought to elicit overlearned action tendencies either to\\nact or refrain from acting, or to approach or withdraw\\n[48,49] \\xe2\\x80\\x93 forms of reflexive post-stimulus control. In young\\nadults, a region of lateral OFC has been found to be active\\nwhen a required response (e.g., withdraw) is incongruent\\nwith the action tendency signaled by a previously presented\\nface (e.g., smiling). Deactivation of this region impairs performance during incongruent trials [50], suggesting that\\nlateral OFC plays a key role in linking stimulus salience\\nwith the need to override habitual actions using explicit\\ncontrol processes. In a second study, we examined fMRI\\nactivation in children and young adults when the presentation of a happy or angry face (mothers and matched strangers) preceded a cue either to press a button or withhold an\\naction [51]. In this study, activation in lateral OFC decreased with age group for the difference between angry\\nand happy faces, showing a parallel pattern to that showed\\nby the amygdala in the free viewing task \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but only during\\n\\nincongruent trials when an action had to be withheld. These\\nfindings indicate that not only does amygdala activation\\nlinked to the affective salience of a stimulus differ across age\\ngroups, but the way affective salience interacts with activation linked to post-event regulatory processes differs as well.\\nIn this case, affect-biased attention favoring a given category of stimulus may influence overlearned habitual responses\\nfollowing an event, which in turn influence explicit control\\nrequired to override the habitual response. Thus, not only\\nmay the tuning of affective biases change across the lifespan,\\nbut such tuning can serve as a form of attentional regulation\\nthat can influence behavior via a cascade of regulatory\\nprocesses along the habitual versus effortful and pre- versus\\npost-event axes. However, future research is required to\\ndirectly link brain activation patterns reported here with\\npre-tuned biases for positive stimuli in young children.\\nIndividual differences in affect-biased attention\\nWe suggest that well-documented individual differences in\\naffect-biased attention to positive or negative stimuli reflect individual differences in habitual employment of\\naffectively motivated control settings, which play a regulatory role by influencing subsequent regulatory processes.\\nA recent study [52] found that participants who were high\\nin a form of neuroticism linked to volatility, which involves\\npredisposition towards anger or irritation, as well as affectbiased attention for negative images, showed greatest\\namygdala activation for negative images, regardless of\\n369\\n\\n\\x0cOpinion\\nwhether they had to approach or avoid them. In contrast,\\nparticipants who were high in neuroticism-avoidance,\\nwhich is characterized by a general pattern of avoidance\\nthat is not linked to attentional biases towards a particular\\nvalence or category, showed greater amygdala activation\\nwhen they had to approach a stimulus regardless of valence. These findings suggest that habitual individual\\ndifferences in affect-biased attention influence the salience\\nof willfully performed actions, which in turn play a role in\\npost-event explicit regulatory processes. In this case, too,\\ntemporally subsequent and more explicit regulatory processes are built on more reflexive ones.\\nAttentional biases influence emotional responding and\\nare trainable\\nIt is well established that some people are predisposed to\\nfocus on threatening aspects of a scene, whereas others\\nfocus on the positive aspects [53,54]. For example, imagine\\nlooking out at a sea of faces before giving a lecture. Some\\npeople habitually zoom in on frowning or bored faces.\\nOthers are predisposed to find smiles of approval. A robust\\nbody of research has linked attentional biases toward\\nthreatening versus neutral or positive images with normative and clinical anxiety [53], and attentional biases for\\nrewarding stimuli have been shown to be associated with\\nsuch personality traits as extraversion [54].\\nStudies investigating attentional biases to stimulus\\ncategory typically use exogenous spatial cueing tasks to\\nmeasure bias, and most often employ variations of a dot\\nprobe task. In a typical dot probe task, response times to a\\nprobe in a spatial location previously occupied by a stimulus of one valence (e.g., an angry face) are compared with\\nthose to a probe in a location previously occupied by a\\nstimulus of another valence (e.g., a smiling or neutral face)\\n[55]. Differences in response time are used as a measure of\\nbiases involving both initial attentional capture by and\\nsubsequent difficulty to disengage attention from the former location of particular valence or category of stimulus\\n[55]. We suggest that such attentional capture by specific\\nstimulus categories may reflect affectively biased control\\nsettings. Moreover, research using dot probe tasks suggests that habitual attentional biases predict emotional\\nresponsiveness to stressors, suggesting that they modulate\\nemotional responding [56,57]. For example, biases for\\nimplicitly presented negative stimuli have been positively\\nassociated with cortisol levels both in response to an inlaboratory stressor (having to give a five minute talk) four\\nmonths later, as well to a major final exam eight months\\nlater [58]. Although this does not provide direct evidence\\nthat attentional biases modulate emotional responses, an\\nimportant body of research on cognitive bias modification\\nhas provided promising evidence that experimental manipulation of attentional biases can influence subsequent\\nanxiety symptoms and responses to stressors.\\nAttention bias modification (ABM) is a form of cognitive\\nbehavior modification that uses an exogenous cueing task\\nto manipulate biases favoring the valence or specific category of a stimulus [59]. In ABM, participants repeatedly\\nperform a dot probe task that manipulates the frequency of\\npresentation of probes in the place of threatening relative\\nto neutral stimuli. Presenting probes in the place of neutral\\n370\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences July 2012, Vol. 16, No. 7\\n\\nstimuli more frequently than threatening ones reduces\\nbiases to threat in a manner that is implicit and based\\non repeated practice. A meta-analysis finding a consistent\\neffect of ABM in shifting attentional biases and reducing\\nanxiety scores in both clinical and non-clinical populations\\n[54] suggests that negative attentional biases render\\nadults more vulnerable to anxiety symptoms and\\nresponses to stress, and that manipulation of biases effectively reduces anxiety. However, it should be noted that\\neffect sizes for ABM influence on anxiety are small and do\\nnot always replicate reliably [60].\\nAttentional biases emerge early, influence behavioral\\noutcomes, and are trainable in children\\nAttentional biases, which are associated with common genetic variations [61], can be measured as early in development as five years [62]. They are also associated with\\nbehavioral outcomes early in development. For example,\\na recent study demonstrated that attentional biases to\\nthreat predicted whether temperamentally inhibited children would demonstrate social withdrawal behaviors at age\\nfive [63]. Moreover, recent research has extended ABM\\ntraining to anxiety reduction in children, as well. In a recent\\nrandomized control trial, clinically anxious children who\\ndemonstrated attention biases for threat were either\\nassigned to an ABM condition or one of two control conditions [64]. After four training sessions over four weeks, only\\nthe children in the ABM condition showed reduced attentional biases and anxiety symptoms as measured in both\\nclinician interviews and on a DSM-IV anxiety severity scale\\nmeasured in a post-treatment session. These findings demonstrate that tuning of habitual deployment of affective\\ncontrol sets over an extended period of time can modulate\\npatterns of emotional response in children, consistent with\\nan important role for affect-biased attention in regulating\\nemotional responses to subsequent stressful events. Longterm effects of such interventions in children \\xe2\\x80\\x93 particularly\\nin comparison with adults \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be an important area for\\nfuture research.\\nDirect measures of affect-biased attention\\nIt is important to note that exogenous spatial cueing tasks,\\nsuch as the dot probe, do not directly measure/manipulate\\nantecedent tuning of perceptual filters to specific categories of stimuli. Thus, they are not direct measures of affectbiased attention as a form of habitual control setting that\\nprecedes stimulus presentation. Rather, they measure\\nrapid capture and/or sustained retention of exogenous\\nspatial attention following presentation of salient stimuli\\n[55]. Thus, they measure the propensity to be oriented by\\naffectively salient stimuli to the spatial location at which\\nthey occur, rather than an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pre-tuning to specific categories of stimulus; however, they may reflect such\\npre-tuning. Although less commonly used for ABM, visual\\nsearch tasks that require participants to locate a specific\\nfacial expression among an array of distractors are better\\nmeasures of the kind of pre-stimulus filtering we describe\\nas affect-biased attention. Here, salience-based biases are\\nmeasured as differences in response times when locating\\nsearch targets of different stimulus categories. To date, at\\nleast one series of studies has trained attentional bias by\\n\\n\\x0cOpinion\\nusing smiling faces as targets among an array of faces with\\nnegative expressions and comparing it to a control condition with flower targets [65]. Repeated training reduced\\nreported stress in response to a final exam in students and\\nreduced stress responses and cortisol in telemarketers.\\nAlthough replication is required, this study offers more\\ndirect evidence that training habits of affect-biased attention over time regulates aspects of emotional response to\\nsubsequent stressors.\\nFuture directions\\nDespite the fact that there are suggestive data supporting\\nour proposal that affect-biased attention is a form of emotion regulation, further research is required to test directly\\nthe influence of affect-biased attention on behavioral and\\nphysiological measures associated with emotional response to emotional challenges, as well as on measures\\nof specific downstream regulatory processes (Box 2). Future research can also draw on animal models and human\\nneurogenetics to elucidate the role of serotonin, as well as\\nother neuromodulators, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, in affect-biased attention. In addition, whereas a\\nnumber of computational models of bottom-up visual salience predict attention deployment based on low-level\\nvisual features (e.g., [21]) and even incorporate aspects\\nof semantic meaning [66], future models can incorporate\\naffective salience parameters to predict attention deployment.\\nWe have suggested that affect-biased attention is tuned\\nthrough experience over development, a claim supported\\nby research investigating the role of early experience in\\nsensitivity to specific expressions [67]. Associative learning\\nhas been proposed as one mechanism underlying such\\ndevelopmental tuning [67], but future research is required\\nto test this hypothesis directly. Finally, given recent interest in meditation techniques for training attentional processes associated with emotion regulation [68,69], another\\nimportant area for future research is investigation of these\\ntechniques for training affective control sets and their\\ninfluence on subsequent emotional responding.\\n\\nBox 2. Questions for future research\\n\\x0f Does affective pre-tuning towards stimulus categories, as can be\\nmeasured by visual search tasks for example, directly influence\\ndownstream emotional (e.g., physiological, self-report) responses? If so, by what mechanisms?\\n\\x0f Can attentional biases be predicted by generating comprehensive\\ncomputational models of stimulus salience that account for\\naffective salience?\\n\\x0f What learning processes underlie the tuning of affective biases\\nover development?\\n\\x0f Given links between serotonin transporter gene variations and\\nattentional biases, what specifically is the role of serotonin in\\ntuning affect-biased attention and what influence does training\\nhave on serotonin-mediated processes? Do other neuromodulators, such as noradrenaline and dopamine, also play a role?\\nConvergent data from animal models and neurogenetic human\\nresearch can help to answer these questions.\\n\\x0f What meditative attention regulation techniques are effective in\\nmodulating affective control settings and how do they influence\\npatterns of emotional response?\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences July 2012, Vol. 16, No. 7\\n\\nConcluding remarks\\nIf affect-biased attention is a form of emotion regulation, as\\nwe have argued here, one might wonder whether any form\\nof emotion is unregulated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and hence whether the term\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98emotion regulation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is ultimately meaningful. In the end,\\nwhen one delineates the full range of subcomponents that\\nmodulate cognition/emotion interactions over multiple\\ntimescales, one may conclude that there is at no stage a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98pure\\xe2\\x80\\x99 emotional response that is not always already regulated in some way.

Nonetheless, we suggest that an inclusive view of\\nemotion regulation continues to serve as a useful heuristic\\nfor understanding behavioral and attentional processes\\nthat modulate emotion.\\nReferences\\n1 Gross, J.J.

Crockett\\nWellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, 12 Queen Square, London WC1N 3BG, UK\\n\\nMoral dilemmas engender conflicts between two traditions: consequentialism, which evaluates actions based\\non their outcomes, and deontology, which evaluates\\nactions themselves. These strikingly resemble two distinct decision-making architectures: a model-based system that selects actions based on inferences about their\\nconsequences; and a model-free system that selects\\nactions based on their reinforcement history. Here, I\\nconsider how these systems, along with a Pavlovian\\nsystem that responds reflexively to rewards and punishments, can illuminate puzzles in moral psychology.\\n\\nConsequentialist and deontological ethics\\nIs it morally permissible to kill one person to save five\\nothers? Moral dilemmas like this engender conflicts between two major traditions in normative ethics. Consequentialism judges the acceptability of actions based on\\ntheir outcomes, and therefore supports killing one to save\\nfive; ceteris paribus, five lives are better than one. By\\ncontrast, deontology judges the acceptability of actions\\naccording to a set of rules; certain actions (e.g., killing)\\nare absolutely wrong, regardless of the consequences.\\nRecent work has shown that experimental manipulations can sway people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgments toward either consequentialism or deontology, suggesting that these\\nperspectives have distinct neural underpinnings [1]. One\\ninfluential account of these findings posits that deontological judgments stem from automatic emotional processes,\\nwhereas consequentialist judgments result from controlled\\ncognitive processes [1]. Others argue that this dual-process\\napproach is computationally insufficient and cannot explain how hypothetical scenarios are transformed into\\nmental representations of actions and outcomes [2]. Universal moral grammar offers a computational theory of\\nproblem transformation, but lacks a neurobiologically\\nplausible, mechanistic description of how values are\\nassigned to mental representations of actions and outcomes, and how those values are integrated to produce a\\nfinal consequentialist or deontological judgment.\\nModel-based and model-free valuation\\nRecent advances in neuroscience offer a fresh perspective.\\nEvaluations of actions and outcomes are guided by distinct\\ndecision-making systems that are psychologically and\\nneurally dissociable [3\\xe2\\x80\\x936]. The model-based system generates a forward-looking decision tree representing the contingencies between actions and outcomes, and the values of\\n\\xc2\\xa7\\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.\\nCorresponding author: Crockett, M.J.

Model-based tree search\\nis computationally expensive, however, and can become\\nintractable when decision trees are elaborately branched.\\nThe computationally simple model-free system does not\\nrely on a forward model. Instead, it evaluates actions based\\non their previously learned values in specific contexts\\n(states): good state-action pairs are those that have produced desirable outcomes in the past (e.g., push door),\\nwhereas bad state-action pairs are those that have produced undesirable outcomes in the past (e.g., push person).\\nBecause the model-free system lacks access to current\\naction\\xe2\\x80\\x93outcome links, it is retrospective rather than prospective and can make suboptimal recommendations in\\nsettings where traditionally good actions lead to undesirable outcomes, or vice versa [3,6].\\nA third, Pavlovian system promotes automatic reflexive\\napproach and withdrawal responses to appetitive and\\naversive stimuli, respectively [6]. Pavlovian biases can\\ninfluence behaviors guided by model-based and model-free\\nevaluations: for example, in aversive Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer, aversive predictions can suppress instrumental actions [4]. Pavlovian biases can also influence\\nmodel-based evaluations themselves: searching a decision\\ntree can be conceptualized as a set of internal actions that\\ncan be suppressed by aversive predictions [6]. This\\namounts to a \\xe2\\x80\\x98pruning\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the decision tree, whereby model-based tree search is curtailed when an aversive outcome\\nis encountered [7].\\nThere is now substantial evidence that model-based,\\nmodel-free, and Pavlovian systems are situated in at least\\npartly distinct brain circuits, although behavioral outputs\\nlikely reflect their combined influence [3,5], and recent\\nevidence suggests that certain regions integrate modelbased and model-free evaluations [8]. These systems often\\narrive at similar conclusions about the best action to take,\\nbut they sometimes disagree. Understanding how such\\nconflicts are resolved is an active topic of research [6].\\nModels of morality\\nOn the surface, consequentialism and deontology appear to\\nmap directly onto model-based and model-free systems,\\nrespectively. Consequentialist and model-based approaches\\nboth evaluate actions based on their outcomes, whereas\\ndeontological and model-free approaches both evaluate\\nthe actions themselves. However, a deeper analysis reveals\\nthat deontological judgments likely arise from sophisticated\\ninteractions between systems.\\nConsider one puzzle. In the classic trolley dilemma, a\\ntrolley is hurtling out of control down the tracks toward five\\nworkers, who will die if you do nothing.

Explaining aversion to physical harms\\nPrevious work attributes deontological judgments to automatic\\nemotional processes [1]. Here, I distinguish between retrospectively\\nrational (but re-trainable) model-free mechanisms and ecologically\\nrational fixed Pavlovian mechanisms, both of which sway judgments\\ntoward deontology in cases in which harm involves physical contact.\\nThe model-free system evaluates contextualized actions on the basis\\nof their reinforcement history. Young children learn through experience\\nthat actions that physically harm others (e.g., hitting, pushing) result in\\naversive outcomes (e.g., punishments, distress cues [9,10]). Simultaneously, parents and society verbally instruct children that physical\\nharm is forbidden, warning about the consequences of transgressions.\\nBoth experience and instruction enable the model-free system to attach\\nnegative value to harmful physical actions toward people, as in a class\\nof algorithms (called Dyna) that complement experiential trial-and-error\\nlearning with hypothetical trial-and-error learning [6]. Importantly,\\nthe latter method, whereby model-free values can be retrained by\\nmodel-based simulations, provides a route via which characteristically\\ndeontological judgments could be adaptive to changes in the environment that are detected by model-based mechanisms.\\nBy contrast, the Pavlovian system triggers responses to predictions\\nof valenced stimuli; whereas the values of stimuli can be learned,\\n\\n[(Box_1)TD$FIG]\\n\\nPavlovian proclivities to approach (avoid) appetitive (aversive) stimuli\\nare fixed, like reflexes. For aversive predictions, one type of Pavlovian\\nresponse is behavioral suppression; this response is ecologically\\nrational in the sense that refraining from action is generally a good\\nstrategy when some actions might produce aversive outcomes [4].\\nAversive predictions embedded within moral dilemmas could evoke\\nPavlovian processes that disfavor active responses, leading to\\ncharacteristically deontological judgments. Harmful actions that\\ninvolve physical contact may generate particularly strong aversive\\npredictions (e.g., fearful expressions, screams, gore).\\nComputational approaches to decision-making account for choices\\nby adding up model-based, model-free, and Pavlovian action values,\\nand then converting those values into action probabilities using a\\nsoftmax function [4,6,7], essentially treating the three systems as\\nseparate experts, each of which \\xe2\\x80\\x98votes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for its preferred action.\\nDifferences in state-action reinforcement histories (which influence\\nmodel-free values) and aversive predictions (which influence Pavlovian values) could result in more \\xe2\\x80\\x98votes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for inaction in the push\\nscenario (Figure ID) than in the trapdoor scenario (Figure IC), leading\\nto a higher proportion of deontological judgments in the former than\\nin the latter.\\n\\nFigure I.

Explaining the means/side-effect distinction\\nBuilding and searching through a decision tree can be conceptualized\\nas a set of internal actions that may be susceptible to Pavlovian biases\\n[6]. One example is the suppression of trains of thought that lead to\\naversive states, or a pruning of the decision tree [7]. Such pruning is\\nPavlovian in that it is reflexively evoked by aversive states and\\npersists even when counterproductive, preventing the pursuit of\\nrewards lurking behind aversive states [7].\\nA critical difference between means and side-effect cases is the\\nposition of harm within the decision tree, which has consequences\\nfor action evaluation in the face of pruning. Consider that modelbased action evaluation integrates the outcomes from all branches\\nof the decision tree, and Pavlovian pruning of branches containing\\naversive outcomes results in a reduced weighting of all the outcomes\\nin a pruned branch. In side-effect cases, pruning results in a higher\\nvalue of \\xe2\\x80\\x98flip switch\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by reducing the weight of the aversive\\noutcome of killing one (compare the left and right panels in Figure IC).\\n\\n[(Box_2)TD$FIG]\\n\\nThe side-effect death is incidental to saving the five individuals, so it\\ncan be safely pruned away while preserving the contribution of\\nsaving five toward the overall action value. This sort of selective\\namnesia for negative side effects is not possible in means cases,\\nhowever. Here, because the aversive outcome of killing one is\\nrequired to obtain the positive outcome of saving five, pruning away\\nthe aversive outcome necessarily also prunes away the positive\\noutcome. Thus, in means cases, although pruning reduces the\\nweight of the negative outcome of killing one (just as in side-effect\\ncases), it also reduces the weight of the positive outcome of saving\\nfive (compare the left and right panels in Figure ID). The divergence\\nin judgments between means and side-effect cases may be\\nexplained by the possibility that in the face of pruning, the positive\\noutcome of saving five contributes less strongly to the overall action\\nvalue in means cases (in which it is pruned away) compared to sideeffect cases (in which it is not).\\n\\nFigure I. (A,B) Example trolley scenarios and typical judgment patterns (data adapted from [2]). (C,D) Decision trees representing actions and outcomes. Pruning occurs\\nat the first aversive outcome encountered. The overall value for flipping the switch (Vflip) is computed by adding the values from all tree branches: the positive value of\\nsaving five individuals (V(5 lives)) and the negative value of killing one (V(1 death)).\\n\\nreleasing a trapdoor) [1,2], even though these cases have\\nidentical outcomes.\\nUnderstanding how different decision systems evaluate\\nactions and outcomes can illuminate puzzles such as the\\npush\\xe2\\x80\\x93trapdoor divergence (Box 1). Consistent with universal moral grammar accounts [2], I propose that the modelbased system transforms hypothetical scenarios into a\\nstructural description of actions and outcomes (i.e., a decision tree). By searching the tree, the model-based system\\nevaluates all possible outcomes and recommends the\\naction that leads to the best outcome.\\nSimultaneously, the model-free system evaluates\\ncontextualized actions, assigning negative values to\\nstate-action pairs with negative reinforcement histories\\n\\n(e.g., push person [9,10]). An important question is how\\nthe model-free system could evaluate actions that have\\nnever been performed directly (e.g., violent acts). One\\npossibility is that action values are learned via observation: a recent study showed that observational model-free\\nlearning engages similar neural structures as does experiential model-free learning [11]. Alternatively, the modelbased system could train the model-free system through\\noff-line simulations [6].\\nFinally, the Pavlovian system may respond to modelbased predictions of aversive outcomes (derived from\\nthe scenario text and represented in the decision tree)\\nor, alternatively, to the model-free aversive values\\nassigned to the described actions [4,6]. Each system\\n365\\n\\n\\x0cForum\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98votes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for its preferred action, and choices are a product\\nof their combined influence. We can explain the difference in judgments for the push and trapdoor cases by\\nconsidering that pushing a person and flipping a switch\\ndiffer in terms of both their reinforcement histories and\\ntheir proximal expected outcomes, which in turn influence the \\xe2\\x80\\x98votes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the model-free and Pavlovian systems\\n(Box 1).\\nConsider a second feature of moral judgment: people\\nreadily distinguish between harm performed as a means to\\na desired end, and harm occurring as a foreseen side effect\\n(Box 2). This distinction can be seen by contrasting the\\ntrapdoor case (described above) with the following sidetrack case: again, a trolley is hurtling out of control down\\nthe tracks toward five workers, who will die if you do\\nnothing. You can flip a switch that will divert the trolley\\nonto a different set of tracks, where a large man is standing. Is it morally permissible to flip the switch, killing the\\nlarge man but saving the five workers? Despite the fact\\nthat outcomes are matched in these cases, people judge\\nflipping the switch in the trapdoor case to be worse than in\\nthe side-track case. Why?\\nIn the trapdoor case, the large man is used as a means:\\nhis body is instrumental in stopping the trolley, preventing\\nit from hitting the five workers. In the side-track case, the\\ndeath of the large man is a foreseen side-effect of the action\\nperformed to save the five workers. The structure of the\\ndecision tree is critical here; the means/side-effect distinction may arise from Pavlovian pruning of model-based tree\\nsearch (Box 2) [7].\\nBecause the neurobiology of model-based, model-free,\\nand Pavlovian systems is reasonably well delineated, the\\ncurrent framework offers a parsimonious explanation of\\nprevious findings. For example, the medial prefrontal\\ncortex (mPFC) seems to play a role in integrating model-free and model-based evaluations [3,5]. The proposal\\nthat model-free evaluations contribute to deontological\\njudgments, together with the possibility that the mPFC\\nincorporates model-free values into moral judgments, can\\naccount for two robust findings in the literature: that\\nphysical contact cases such as push, commonly associated\\nwith deontological judgments, activate the mPFC [1]; and\\nthat patients with mPFC lesions show a reduced tendency\\ntoward deontological judgments in those same cases [12].\\nPavlovian aversive predictions have been linked to serotonin function [4,7]; if such predictions play a key role in\\ndeontological judgments, enhancing serotonin function\\nshould increase deontological judgments, which has indeed been demonstrated [13]. Finally, there is evidence\\nthat stress shifts control from model-based to model-free\\nsystems [14]. My account suggests that stress should\\nsimilarly promote deontological judgments, as recently\\nreported [15].\\n\\n366\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences August 2013, Vol. 17, No. 8\\n\\nConcluding remarks\\nOne benefit of multiple decision systems is that each\\nprovides advantages in certain situations. Model-based\\ncontrol is optimal for simple decisions. However, when\\nthe decision tree is too extensive and tree search becomes\\ncomputationally intractable, model-free and Pavlovian\\nmechanisms provide useful heuristics. Perhaps multiple\\nethical systems exist for similar reasons. Consequentialism\\nprovides a flexible framework for maximizing good and\\nminimizing evil, but in the face of uncertain or ambiguous\\noutcomes that are commonly encountered in real-world\\nmoral dilemmas, deontological rules help to keep us out\\nof trouble. Whether normative models of decision-making\\ncan inform normative ethics remains a tantalizing question.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust.

We discuss this intriguing\\nfinding, review its implications for understanding the\\netiology of psychopathology, and suggest that psychosocial treatment research would strongly benefit from\\nroutinely assessing genetic variation in clinical trials.\\nA recently published article by Eley and colleagues [1]\\nprovides tantalizing preliminary evidence that variation\\nin the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene\\n(i.e., 5-HTTLPR) predicts response to cognitive behavior\\ntherapy (CBT) among children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Specifically, children with two copies of the\\nlow expressing S-allele had better symptomatic response\\nto treatment at follow-up (i.e., 6 months after completion\\nof CBT) than children with one or two copies of the\\nL-allele.\\nThese findings are fascinating and provocative for a\\nnumber of reasons. They provide additional evidence that\\ninteractions between genetic variation and environmental\\nexperiences (G\\x02E) can influence the development (or in\\nthis case remission) of psychiatric outcomes. Although\\nmost prior G \\x02 E work has examined the interaction\\nbetween genetic variation and naturally occurring experiences, Eley et al. [1] directly manipulate environmental\\ninfluence by providing a putatively efficacious psychotherapy for anxiety. Although it would have been ideal for this\\nstudy to include a no-treatment control to account for\\npassage of time, and we eagerly await replication studies,\\nthese data nevertheless support a G \\x02 E framework.\\nWithin the larger framework of G \\x02 E research, there\\nhas been vigorous debate about whether the 5-HTTLPR\\npolymorphism in particular contributes to the etiology of\\nmood and anxiety symptoms by influencing sensitivity to\\nthe environment [2]. Much of the early debate focused on\\nwhether 5-HTTLPR facilitates negative consequences in\\nadverse environments. However, more recent data, including Eley et al. [1], suggest that 5-HTTLPR is also linked\\nwith positive outcomes in supportive environments. Rather than only increasing vulnerability to negative outcomes,\\nthe 5-HTTLPR genotype may flexibly influence behavior\\ndepending on environmental context [3]. This plasticity\\nmodel may explain why the S-allele is maintained in\\nthe human population over evolutionary time given that\\nCorresponding author: Beevers, C.G. (beevers@psy.utexas.edu).\\n\\nselection pressures should favor polymorphisms associated\\nwith adaptive outcomes.\\nGiven that CBT is a multimodal intervention that\\ninfluences a variety of cognitive and behavioral processes,\\nit is possible that 5-HTTLPR variation might have even\\ngreater predictive power for a more focused treatment.\\nThere is consistent evidence that 5-HTTLPR is associated\\nwith biased attention for emotion cues [4]. Importantly,\\none emerging form of treatment for anxiety is attention\\nbias modification [5] \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a procedure that trains anxious\\nindividuals to shift attention away from threat stimuli.\\nIt follows that anxious S-allele carriers may be particularly\\nresponsive to attention bias modification [6]. Clinical trials\\nexamining whether 5-HTTLPR variation moderates the\\nimpact of attention training on anxiety symptoms among\\nclinical samples are forthcoming.\\nWe also look forward to future research that examines\\nwhether other putatively functional variants in the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and other genes influence\\nresponse to psychotherapy. To do so, newly developed\\nanalytic strategies, such as a cumulative genetic score\\n(CGS), which attempt to aggregate genetic effects across\\npolymorphisms and/or genes [7], would be particularly\\nuseful. The CGS approach is substantially different from\\nexamining a single polymorphism in isolation. CGS analyses combine contributions from multiple polymorphisms\\ninto a single parameter in an effort to increase variance\\nexplained, whilst simultaneously accounting for \\xe2\\x80\\x98genetic\\nbackground\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that might otherwise obscure single variant\\neffects. Thus, this innovative analytic approach could have\\nfar more explanatory power than analyses examining a\\nsingle polymorphism, the dominant approach for candidate gene association studies.\\nFurthermore, a model that integrates genetic, neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral levels of analysis\\n(among others) could provide a roadmap for how to treat\\nmood disturbance more effectively. Currently, most treatments target a single level of analysis; an integrated\\nmodel could suggest a more synergistic approach to treatment. For instance, improving prefrontal cortical function\\nmay facilitate the efficacy of CBT for depression [8].\\nSimilarly, D-Cycloserine, a partial agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor that enhances extinction learning, has been used to augment CBT for panic disorder [9].\\nGenetic information could be used to determine who is\\nmost likely to respond to these forms of treatments.\\nWe believe that integrating knowledge across levels of\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cSpotlights\\nanalysis has the potential to substantially improve treatment efficacy.\\nAlthough genotyping for personalized medicine will\\npotentially increase the costs of existing treatment strategies, genotyping costs are dropping rapidly due to advances\\nin technology. More importantly, increased treatment\\ncosts can still be cost-effective to the extent that the\\nincremental costs improve patient functioning and increase treatment success rates. For example, use of antidepressant medication increases the cost of treatment in a\\nvalue-added fashion that justifies the incremental cost,\\neven though antidepressant medication can take weeks\\nto show an effect [10]. Just as pharmacogenetic strategies\\naspire to match patients to medications to improve efficacy\\nand reduce noncompliance due to side effects, genetically\\ntargeted behavioral treatments may also reduce time to\\nremission. Use of a genetic test as a biomarker of a neurocognitive vulnerability (e.g., attention bias) may allow\\nmore focused and effective treatments to be provided to\\nthose who are most likely to benefit. With an estimated cost\\nof $700 per day for in-patient treatment for depression, the\\nreduction of hospitalization even by a single day by using a\\nsuccessful genetic matching strategy more than covers the\\ncost of genotyping. The possibility that genetic testing can\\nincrease value of treatment efforts more than the cost of\\nthe testing itself is an intriguing possibility that has not yet\\nbeen examined for psychiatric outcomes. This is an important avenue for future research.\\nIn conclusion, we believe that the Eley et al. [1] study is\\nan excellent example of why genetic variation can (and\\nshould) be incorporated into psychosocial treatment research.

What are these cognitive\\ndifferences and how does bilingualism lead to these changes?\\nThe context for examining how bilingualism affects cognitive ability is functional neuroplasticity, that is, the study\\nof how experience modifies brain structure and brain function. Such modifications have been found following experiences as diverse as juggling [2], video-game playing [3],\\ncareers in architecture [4], taxi-driving [5], and musical\\ntraining [6,7]. Bilingualism is different from all of these:\\nlike juggling and playing video games, it is intense, and, like\\narchitecture and driving taxis in London, it is sustained, but,\\nunlike these experiences, bilinguals are not typically preselected for talent or interest. Although bilinguals undoubtedly differ from monolinguals in certain ways, they generally did not choose bilingualism. Rather, the circumstances\\nof their family, place of birth, or immigration history simply\\nrequired that they learn more than one language.\\nWhat is different about bilingual minds?\\nIt has long been assumed that childhood bilingualism\\naffected developing minds, but the belief was that the\\nconsequences for children were negative: learning two\\nlanguages would be confusing [8]. A study by Peal and\\nLambert [9] cast doubt on this belief by reporting that\\nchildren in Montreal who were either French-speaking\\nmonolinguals or English\\xe2\\x80\\x93French bilinguals performed differently on a battery of tests. The authors had expected to\\nfind lower scores in the bilingual group on language tasks\\nbut equivalent scores in non-verbal spatial tasks, but\\ninstead found that the bilingual children were superior\\non most tests, especially those requiring symbol manipulation and reorganization. This unexpected difference between monolingual and bilingual children was later\\nexplored in studies showing a significant advantage for\\nbilingual children in their ability to solve linguistic problems based on understanding such concepts as the difference between form and meaning, that is, metalinguistic\\nawareness [10\\xe2\\x80\\x9316] and non-verbal problems that required\\nparticipants to ignore misleading information [17,18].\\nResearch with adult bilinguals built on these studies with\\nchildren and reported two major trends. First, a large body\\nof evidence now demonstrates that the verbal skills of\\nbilinguals in each language are generally weaker than\\nare those for monolingual speakers of each language.\\n\\n1364-6613/$ \\xe2\\x80\\x93 see front matter \\xc3\\x9f 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

On picture-naming tasks, bilingual participants are slower [21\\xe2\\x80\\x9324] and less accurate [25,26] than\\nmonolinguals. Slower responses for bilinguals are also found\\nfor both comprehending [27] and producing words [28], even\\nwhen bilinguals respond in their first and dominant language. Finally, verbal fluency tasks are a common neuropsychological measure of brain functioning in which\\nparticipants are asked to generate as many words as they\\ncan in 60 s that conform to a phonological or semantic cue.\\nPerformance on these tasks reveals systematic deficits for\\nbilingual participants, particularly in semantic fluency conditions [29\\xe2\\x80\\x9333], even if responses can be provided in either\\nlanguage [34]. Thus, the simple act of retrieving a common\\nword is more effortful for bilinguals.\\nIn contrast to this pattern, bilinguals at all ages demonstrate better executive control than monolinguals matched in\\nage and other background factors. Executive control is the set\\nof cognitive skills based on limited cognitive resources for\\nsuch functions as inhibition, switching attention, and working memory [35]. Executive control emerges late in development and declines early in aging, and supports such activities\\nas high-level thought, multi-tasking, and sustained attention. The neuronal networks responsible for executive control\\nare centered in the frontal lobes, with connections to other\\nbrain regions as necessary for specific tasks. In children,\\nexecutive control is central to academic achievement [36],\\nand, in turn, academic success is a significant predictor of long\\nterm health and well being [37]. In a recent meta-analysis,\\nAdesope et al. [38] calculated medium to large effect sizes for\\nthe executive control advantages in bilingual children, and\\nHilchey and Klein [39] summarized the bilingual advantage\\nover a large number of studies with adults. This advantage\\nhas been shown to extend into older age and protect against\\ncognitive decline [21,40,41], a point to which we turn below.\\nIn this review, we examine the evidence for bilingual\\nadvantages in executive control and explore the possible\\nmechanisms and neural correlates that may help to explain them. Our conclusion is that lifelong experience in\\nmanaging attention to two languages reorganizes specific\\nbrain networks, creating a more effective basis for executive control and sustaining better cognitive performance\\nthroughout the lifespan.\\nLanguage processing in bilinguals\\nJoint activation of languages\\nA logical possibility for the organization of a bilingual mind\\nis that it consists of two independently-represented language systems that are uniquely accessed in response to\\nthe context: a fluent French\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilingual ordering\\ncoffee in a Parisian cafe\\xc2\\xb4 has no reason to consider how to\\nform the request in English, and a Cantonese\\xe2\\x80\\x93English\\nbilingual studying psychology in Boston does not need to\\nrecast the material through Chinese. Yet, substantial evidence shows that this is not how the bilingual mind is\\norganized. Instead, fluent bilinguals show some measure of\\nactivation of both languages and some interaction between\\nthem at all times, even in contexts that are entirely driven\\nby only one of the languages.\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences April 2012, Vol. 16, No. 4\\n\\nThe evidence for this conclusion comes from psycholinguistic studies using such tasks as cross-language priming\\n(in which a word in one language facilitates retrieval of a\\nsemantically related word in the other language) and\\nlexical decision (in which participants decide whether a\\nstring of letters is an actual word in one of the languages)\\nthat show the influence of the currently unused language\\nfor both comprehension and production of speech [42\\xe2\\x80\\x9348].\\nFurther evidence comes from patient studies showing\\nintrusions from the irrelevant language or inappropriate\\nlanguage switches [49], and imaging studies indicating\\ninvolvement of the non-target language while performing\\na linguistic task in the selected language [50\\xe2\\x80\\x9352]. Using\\neye-tracking technology, for example, Marian, Spivey, and\\nHirsch [53] reported that English\\xe2\\x80\\x93Russian bilinguals performing a task in English in which they had to look at the\\nnamed picture from four alternatives were distracted by a\\npicture the name of which shared phonology with Russian,\\neven though there was no connection to the meaning of the\\ntarget picture and no contextual cues indicating that Russian was relevant. Similarly, Thierry and Wu [54] presented English monolinguals, Chinese\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilinguals,\\nand Chinese monolinguals with pairs of words in English\\n(translated to Chinese for Chinese monolinguals) and\\nasked participants to decide if the words were semantically\\nrelated or not. The manipulation was that half of the pairs\\ncontained a repeated character in the written Chinese\\nforms, even though that orthographic feature was unrelated to the English meaning. Waveforms derived from analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) are used to indicate\\nthe neuronal response to language on a millisecond by\\nmillisecond scale. An event-related potential (ERP) called\\nthe N400 (i.e. a negative-going waveform peaking approximately 400 msec after the onset of a target stimulus)\\nsignals the effort associated with integrating the meaning\\nof words. The more similar the words are to each other, the\\nsmaller is the amplitude of the N400. In the study by\\nThierry and Wu, semantic relatedness was associated with\\nsignificantly smaller N400 amplitude in all groups as\\nexpected, but the repeated character also led to smaller\\nN400 for the two Chinese groups. Thus, although irrelevant to the task, participants were accessing the Chinese\\nforms when making judgments about the semantic relation\\nbetween English words. Subsequent research has refined\\nthese results by showing their basis in the phonology\\nrather than the orthography of spoken language [55]\\nand extended the phenomenon to the phonological hand\\nforms of American Sign Language [56].\\nThis joint activation is the most likely mechanism for\\nunderstanding the consequences of bilingualism for both\\nlinguistic and non-linguistic processing. For linguistic processing, joint activation creates an attention problem that\\ndoes not exist for monolinguals: in addition to selection\\nconstraints on such dimensions as register, collocation, and\\nsynonymy, the bilingual speaker also has to select the\\ncorrect language from competing options. Although joint\\nactivation creates a risk for language interference and\\nlanguage errors, these rarely occur, indicating that the\\nselection of the target language occurs with great accuracy.\\nHowever, this need to select at the level of language system\\nmakes ordinary linguistic processing more effortful for\\n241\\n\\n\\x0cReview\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences April 2012, Vol. 16, No. 4\\n\\nbilinguals than monolinguals and explains some of the\\ncosts in psycholinguistic studies described above. For\\nnon-linguistic processing, the need to resolve competition\\nand direct attention is primarily the responsibility of general cognitive systems, in particular executive functions.\\nThe possible influence of linguistic processes on non-linguistic executive control has significant consequences for\\nlifespan cognition and is discussed in the next section.\\n\\nrelationship between inhibition and ability in verbal and\\nnon-verbal tasks by showing a correlation between Stroop\\ntask performance and competing word selection [64], Simon task performance and language switching in picture\\nnaming [65], and cross-language interference and a variety\\nof executive control measures [66]. Such results point to an\\nextensive reorganization of cognitive and linguistic processes in bilinguals.\\n\\nConsequences of joint activation\\nAn appealing suggestion for how the executive control\\nsystem achieves linguistic selection in the context of joint\\nactivation is through inhibition of the non-target language.\\nAt least two influential models have been proposed that\\nplace inhibition at the center of this selection. The first, the\\nInhibitory Control model [57] is based on the Supervisory\\nAttentional System [58] and extends a domain-general and\\nresource-limited attention system to the management of\\ncompeting languages. The second, the Bilingual Interactive Activation Model (BIA+) [59], uses computer simulation to model lexical selection from both intralingual and\\nextralingual competitors. Although both models assign a\\nprimary role to inhibition, they are very different from each\\nother and address a different aspect of the selection problem. It is useful, therefore, to consider the distinction\\nbetween global inhibition and local inhibition proposed\\nby De Groot and Christoffels [60]. Global inhibition refers\\nto suppression of an entire language system, as in inhibiting French when speaking English, and local inhibition\\nrefers to inhibition of a specific competing distractor, such\\nas the translation equivalent of the required concept. Both\\nprocesses are required for fluent language selection but the\\ntwo are carried out differently. Guo, Liu, Misra, and Kroll\\n[61] used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to\\ndemonstrate the recruitment of different systems for each\\nof global inhibition (dorsal left frontal gyrus and parietal\\ncortex) and local inhibition (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area) in a sample of Chinese\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nEnglish bilinguals, and validated their distinct roles in\\nbilingual language control. Although Green\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inhibitory\\ncontrol model is consistent with both types of inhibition,\\nDijkstra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s BIA+ model is limited to modeling item selection\\nin local inhibition.\\nThese types of inhibition also differ in their primary\\ndomain of influence, with local inhibition largely affecting\\nlinguistic performance and global inhibition affecting both\\nlinguistic and cognitive performance. The linguistic outcomes of inhibition are reduced speed and fluency of lexical\\naccess for bilinguals as described above. However, performance also requires a selection bias towards the target\\nlanguage, showing a role for activation [62,63] as well as\\ninhibition. These alternatives are not mutually exclusive\\nbut indicate the need for a more complete description of\\nhow attention is managed in bilingual language processing. Ultimately the degree of both inhibition and activation are relative rather than absolute and will be\\nmodulated by contextual, linguistic, and cognitive factors.\\nThe cognitive outcomes of linguistic inhibition are enhanced attentional control and will be described more fully\\nin the next section. Importantly, the cognitive and linguistic outcomes are related. Three studies have reported a\\n\\nCognitive networks in bilinguals\\nBilingual performance on conflict tasks\\nEarly evidence that bilingual children solved non-verbal\\nconflict tasks differently from monolingual children was\\nreported in a study by Bialystok and Majumder [17]. Eightyear-old children were given a variety of non-verbal\\nproblems to solve, some of which contained perceptual\\ndistraction (block design from the Wechsler Intelligence\\nScale for Children, WISC [67]) and some which did not\\n(Noelting\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Juice Task [68,69]). Bilingual children outperformed monolinguals on the conflict tasks, but children in\\nthe two groups were comparable on tasks that did not\\ninclude distracting perceptual information. This pattern\\nhas been confirmed in studies of both children and adults\\nusing a flanker task (children: [70,71]), theory of mind task\\n(children: [72,73]; adults: [74]), Simon task (children: [75];\\nadults: [40]). Other studies with adults have shown better\\nperformance by bilinguals in naming the font color in a\\nStroop task [21], smaller costs in task switching [76], better\\nability to maintain task set in an attention task [77], and\\nmore susceptibility to negative priming, presumably because of greater inhibition [78].\\nSome studies have extended these bilingual advantages\\ninto older age. Bialystok, Craik, Klein and Viswanathan\\n[40] reported an experiment in which middle-aged and\\nolder adults who were either monolingual or bilingual were\\ngiven a version of the Simon task. Participants were shown\\neither a green or a red square on each trial, and the task\\nwas to press an associated response key as rapidly as\\npossible. The keys were located at each side of the presentation screen. In one condition, the squares appeared\\ncentrally on the screen, so there was no spatial conflict\\nbetween the location of stimuli and responses; in this\\ncondition there were no reaction-time (RT) differences\\nbetween language groups. In a second condition, the colored squares appeared laterally on the screen, either directly above the appropriate response key (congruent\\ncondition) or on the other side of the screen, above the\\nincorrect response key (incongruent condition). The RT\\ndifference between congruent and incongruent response\\ntrials (the Simon effect) is a measure of attentional control.\\nBilinguals produced smaller Simon effects than monolinguals at all ages.\\nThree other results from this study are noteworthy.\\nFirst, the decrease in attentional control in older adults\\nwas reduced in the bilingual groups, suggesting that bilingualism may be protective against the effects of cognitive\\naging. Second, whereas a bilingual advantage was\\nexpected for incongruent stimuli, it was also found for\\ncongruent stimuli. This result has been replicated in subsequent studies [39] and is difficult to account for in terms\\nof response conflict or inhibition. Third, prolonged practice\\n\\n242\\n\\n\\x0cReview\\nreduced both the Simon effect and the size of the bilingual\\nadvantage. Apparently all participants can learn to disregard the distracting effects of interfering stimuli given\\nsufficient practice on a task, but it seems that bilinguals\\ncan learn this type of inhibition more rapidly. One interesting question in this regard is the extent to which this\\nattenuation of attentional control is specific to the practiced situation, or whether it generalizes to tasks tapping\\nattentional control in a different manner. Our conjecture is\\nthat the attenuation effect is context specific.\\nA complication that has emerged as more results are\\nreported is that the bilingual advantage is not always\\nfound in samples of young adults. For example, a study\\nexamining performance on the Simon task in 5-year-olds,\\nyoung, middle-aged and older adults found a bilingual\\nadvantage in RT in the 5-year-olds and in the older adults,\\nbut not in the young adult group [79]. Similarly, a study of\\nthe Stroop effect in younger and older adults found a\\nbilingual advantage in both age groups but when the same\\nparticipants performed the Simon arrow task the bilingual\\nadvantage was found only in the older adults [21]. Similarly, Salvatierra and Rosselli [41] used a simple version of\\nthe Simon task and reported a bilingual advantage for\\nolder but not younger adults. There is thus some evidence\\nthat the bilingual advantage is greatest in children and in\\nolder adults, but less constantly present in young adults \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nperhaps because the young adult group is at the developmentally peak age for cognitive control.\\nIt appears that bilingual advantages for young adults\\ntend to emerge on tasks or conditions that are difficult. For\\nexample, Bialystok [80] found that bilingual young adults\\noutperformed their monolingual counterparts on the directional arrow Simon task, but only on the condition that\\nincluded more monitoring and switching than a simpler\\ncondition. Similarly, several studies by Costa and colleagues have reported a bilingual advantage in young adults\\n[71,81,82] but only under some conditions. For example,\\nCosta et al. [81] demonstrated that the bilingual advantage\\non a flanker task held only under high monitoring conditions. In versions where most of the trials were of one type\\n(congruent or incongruent), no bilingual advantage was\\nobserved; the advantage was found, however, in a condition\\ninvolving 25% incongruent and 75% congruent trials, although even there the advantage decreased over blocks of\\nthe experiment (cf. [44]). Costa et al. [81] concluded that the\\nbilingual advantage reflects a more efficient monitoring\\nsystem for conflict resolution, in that bilinguals may be\\nbetter at determining when the misleading information\\ncan be safely ignored. Finally, Herna\\xc2\\xb4ndez et al. [82] used a\\nnon-linguistic version of the Stroop effect and found a trend\\ntowards both reduced interference and enhanced facilitation in young adult bilinguals compared with monolinguals\\n(cf. older participants in [21]). One interesting aspect of the\\nstudies by Costa, Herna\\xc2\\xb4ndez and colleagues is that the\\nmonolinguals were Spanish speakers and the bilinguals\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ntwo languages were Catalan and Spanish. Most of the\\nparticipants were undergraduate students and were not\\nimmigrants, so the two groups were well equated apart\\nfrom the language difference. In summary, the evidence for\\na bilingual advantage in younger adults is more sporadic\\nthan in other age groups, although at all ages there are\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences April 2012, Vol. 16, No. 4\\n\\nsome reports of studies showing no difference between\\nmonolinguals and bilinguals performing a conflict task.\\nNeural correlates of cognitive reorganization\\nRecently, studies have begun to investigate the neural\\ncorrelates of bilingual processing examined in the behavioral research. The majority of this research has used fMRI\\nto study bilinguals performing a linguistic task in their two\\nlanguages. Typically, participants name pictures or generate words in response to a cue signaling the required\\nlanguage, and performance is compared for single language and mixed language conditions. Two early studies\\nrevealed promising results. The first led to the surprising\\nfinding that language switching was accompanied by activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), an\\narea known to be part of the general executive control\\nsystem [24]. Less surprising was a study showing the\\ninvolvement of Broca\\xe2\\x80\\x99s area as well as a left frontal\\narea in a language switching task [83]. Subsequent research has corroborated the involvement of these systems\\nand has shown that language switching elicits a spatiallydistributed activation pattern involving bilateral frontal\\nand precentral areas, bilateral caudate, bilateral (or midline) pre-supplementary areas (pre-SMA), and bilateral\\ntemporal regions. This pattern has been found for German-French bilinguals [84], Spanish-Catalan bilinguals\\n[85], Chinese\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilinguals [61,86,87] and Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilinguals [88]. A few studies [61,84] have also\\nreported activation in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but\\nactivation in this area is not consistently observed. Abutalebi and colleagues [89] extended this finding to show\\nactivation of ACC for both language switching and nonverbal switching. Importantly, these studies confirm that\\nfrontal systems involved in executive control are recruited\\nby bilinguals to manage attention to language.\\nAbutalebi and Green [90] conducted a qualitative review\\nof these studies and proposed that the ACC, left prefrontal\\ncortex, left caudate and bilateral supramarginal gyri (SMG)\\nconstitute the neural correlates of the control mechanism for\\nbilingual language production. This model was confirmed in\\na quantitative meta-analysis examining bilingual language\\nswitching [91] (Figure 1). Both the qualitative and quantitative analyses point to multiple cortical regions in which\\nfunctional activity is altered by bilingualism, but an outstanding question is whether activity in these regions is\\nsynchronous, forming a neural network that is responsive to\\nbilinguals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experience of managing two languages. To this\\nend, a study by Nakamura and colleagues [92] showed\\nstrong connectivity between left inferior frontal gyrus\\n(IFG) and left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) in a group of\\nJapanese\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilinguals performing a cross-language\\npriming task. The connectivity was stronger in the frontaltemporal coupling than in the reverse direction. This pattern was replicated using transcranial magnetic stimulation\\n(TMS) with Japanese\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilingual participants performing the same cross-language priming task. Nakamura\\nand colleagues [92] interpreted the results as indicating topdown control from left IFG to left MTG in a bilingual context.\\nTaken together, fMRI research on bilingual language\\nswitching has implicated distributed cortical activation\\nthat converges in the frontal regions. Intriguingly, the\\n243\\n\\n\\x0cReview\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences April 2012, Vol. 16, No. 4\\n\\nLeft\\n\\nRight\\nTRENDS in Cognitive Sciences\\n\\nFigure 1. Bilingual influence on brain function and structure. Transparent brains showing the left and right hemispheres. Green voxels depict grey matter regions showing\\nhigh activation during bilingual language switching in a meta-analysis [90]. Red\\xe2\\x80\\x93yellow voxels indicate regions of higher white matter integrity in bilingual older adults\\nrelative to monolinguals [107]. Together, the functional and structural data indicate that neural correlates of bilingualism are observed in the frontal lobes, generally\\nresponsible for higher cognition such as executive functions.\\n\\nbrain regions related to bilingual switching are also critical\\nfor general attention and cognitive control [93,94]. This\\noverlap in brain regions activated for bilingual switching\\nand cognitive control implies that the same mechanisms\\nmay be involved in both activities, and that these shared\\nprocesses might help to explain the superior performance\\nof bilinguals on non-verbal conflict tasks. In other words,\\nusing these cognitive control networks for bilingual language processing may reconfigure them for other purposes,\\nproviding part of the explanation for the behavioral differences between monolinguals and bilinguals found in nonverbal conflict tasks. Specifically, the evidence suggests\\nthat cognitive control networks may be more broadly based\\nin bilinguals as a result of their dual function. However,\\nfMRI studies on language switching in bilinguals can only\\nshow that these networks are included in bilingual language selection. Determining whether or not such reconfiguration occurs can only be evaluated by comparing\\nmonolinguals and bilinguals performing non-verbal conflict tasks. The hypothesis is that monolinguals and bilinguals will perform non-verbal control problems using\\nsomewhat different networks, specifically, that the network used by bilinguals will be more broadly based.\\nOnly a few studies have contrasted the neural correlates\\nof non-linguistic cognitive control in bilinguals and monolinguals. Garbin and colleagues [95] gave a color-shape\\nswitching task to Spanish monolingual and SpanishCatalan bilingual young adults in fMRI. A bivalent stimulus (e.g. a red circle) and a cue (e.g. \\xe2\\x80\\x98color\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98shape\\xe2\\x80\\x99) were\\nshown, and participants responded to the indicated dimension. Both RT of switch costs and accuracy favored the\\nbilingual participants, but activation patterns were also\\ndifferent for the two groups: monolinguals showed increased activation in the right IFG, whereas bilinguals\\nshowed increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus.\\nMore interestingly, higher levels of activation in left IFG\\nand left striatum were associated with smaller switch costs\\nfor the bilingual participants, but increased activation in\\nthe right IFG was associated with larger switch costs. In\\n244\\n\\nlight of the lack of switching effect in the behavioral data, it\\nis possible that the bilinguals relied more on the left IFG\\nand striatum in face of the demand to switch between\\nresponses associated with a bivalent stimulus. The left\\nIFG was identified in both the qualitative [90] and quantitative [91] meta-analyses of bilingual language switching.\\nThis region is central to speech production [96] and has\\nbeen shown to have higher activation for bilinguals than\\nmonolinguals during speech production [97,98]. Thus, left\\nIFG appears to be one of the overlapping brain regions in\\nbilinguals handling both language switching and non-linguistic cognitive control.\\nA study by Luk and colleagues [99] used an adaptation\\nof a flanker task to compare activation in monolingual and\\nbilingual participants. The stimuli consisted of a string of\\nfive chevrons, and the task was to indicate the direction of\\nthe red one (that could appear in one of three positions)\\nwhile ignoring the four black ones. In a previous behavioral\\nstudy with these stimuli, bilinguals performed this task\\nmore rapidly than monolinguals [100]. The fMRI data were\\nanalyzed using a multivariate statistical technique for\\nneuroimaging data (Partial Least Squares; for review,\\nsee [101]) to identify integrated neural networks. The\\nresults showed that monolinguals and bilinguals recruited\\ndifferent neural networks for both congruent and incongruent trials. Another condition that tested \\xe2\\x80\\x98no-go\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nresponses indicated no difference between groups. Importantly, greater activity in the bilingual network, including\\nareas identified in the meta-analysis [91], was related to\\nsmaller RT costs for incongruent trials. There are two\\nimplications of these results. First, bilingualism alters\\nfunctional neural network at the response-selection level\\n(congruent and incongruent trials), but not at the motor\\nexecution level (response inhibition no-go trials), a pattern\\nconsistent with previous results for both adults [102] and\\nchildren [75,103]. Second, bilinguals showed a brainbehavior correlation when suppressing interference from\\nconflicting flankers, replicating a previous study using\\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG) [104].\\n\\n\\x0cReview\\nAlthough bilingualism is a language experience, managing attention to two languages imposes demands on the\\ncognitive system that require brain regions not typically\\nused for language processing. From studies of bilingual\\nlanguage switching and non-linguistic cognitive control,\\nand from the meta-analysis cited earlier, it seems likely\\nthat the neural locus of cognitive control in bilinguals lies\\nin bilateral frontal regions. In order to facilitate information transfer between the hemispheres, it is also possible\\nthat prolonged bilingual experience alters anatomical\\nstructures in addition to cortical functional networks. Cortical activity assessed by fMRI is limited to blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the grey matter.\\nHowever, when investigating domain-general neural\\nchanges (cognitive control) in response to domain-specific\\nexperience (bilingualism), it is important to use methods\\nthat allow not only the identification of functional networks but also their underlying anatomical structures\\n[105,106].\\nThere is some evidence for the plasticity of cortical grey\\nmatter in response to bilingualism. Mechelli et al. [107]\\nreported higher grey matter density in left inferior parietal\\nregions in a group of Italian\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilinguals relative to\\nEnglish monolinguals. Strikingly, proficiency in English,\\nthe second language, correlated positively with grey matter density in this region. A recent study has extended\\nbrain plasticity to white matter. Luk, Bialystok, Craik and\\nGrady [108] (Figure 1) used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)\\nand fMRI to measure white matter integrity and restingstate functional connectivity in monolingual and bilingual\\nolder adults. The results showed higher white matter\\nintegrity in bilingual older adults, primarily in the corpus\\ncallosum connecting the two hemispheres but also extending to bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculi, right inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus.\\nIdentifying a seed close to the white matter voxels showing\\na group difference, Luk et al. conducted a resting-state\\nfunctional connectivity analysis and showed that while\\nboth monolinguals and bilinguals had correlating brain\\nactivity with contralateral regions at rest, bilinguals had\\nincreased anterior-posterior connectivity. This evidence\\nsuggests that bilingualism is associated with better maintenance of white matter structures in the course of normal\\naging [109]. Similar DTI results have also been recently\\nreported in bilingual children around the left inferior\\nfrontal-occipital fasciculus [110].\\nThe nature of the bilingual advantage\\nWhy might bilingualism be associated with an advantage\\nin attentional control? The need to manage two jointly\\nactivated languages apparently leads to an enhancement\\nof frontal-posterior attentional control mechanisms with\\nthe consequence that other types of cognitive control are\\nalso enhanced. Inhibitory control was suggested as the\\nrelevant mechanism in early studies [40,57] and continues\\nto be endorsed by some researchers [47,111]. One problem\\nwith this account, however, is the recurrent finding of a\\nbilingual advantage in congruent trials (for which there is\\nno conflict) as well as incongruent trials [40,71]. Minimally,\\ntherefore, inhibition alone is insufficient to explain bilingual processing differences. The inhibition view is also\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences April 2012, Vol. 16, No. 4\\n\\nBox 1. Bilingualism in infancy\\nResearch with infants being raised in bilingual homes has produced\\ndramatic evidence for very early effects of bilingualism and\\nchallenges some standard explanations for the mechanism underlying these effects. It has long been known that children being raised\\nwith two languages do not confuse the languages when learning to\\nspeak, even though they may borrow from one when speaking the\\nother [127]. It is also well known that monolingual infants lose the\\nability to make phonetic discriminations not present in their\\nlanguage by approximately 10 months old, whereas bilingual\\ninfants continue to distinguish between phonetic categories relevant to all languages. Thus, it is not surprising that bilingual infants\\ncan differentiate between their two languages essentially from birth\\n[128]. What is surprising, however, is the extension of this\\ndiscrimination to non-acoustic properties of language. Weikum\\nand colleagues [129] showed silent video clips to 8-month-old\\ninfants who were being raised in homes that were either monolingual English or English\\xe2\\x80\\x93French bilingual. Using a habituation\\nparadigm, the speaker switched languages after habituation and the\\nresearchers measured whether or not infants regained interest. The\\nresults showed renewed attention among the bilingual but not the\\nmonolingual infants. To determine whether the bilingual infants had\\nlearned about the facial structures that accompany each language or\\nsomething more general, the same materials were presented to\\nmonolingual Spanish (or Catalan) infants and bilingual Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nCatalan infants [130]. Again, only the bilingual infants noticed the\\nchange in language, even though the children in this study had no\\nexperience with either language. The authors concluded that\\nbilingualism enhances general perceptual attentiveness through\\nthe experience of attending to two sets of visual cues.\\nThis enhanced perceptual attentiveness may help explain the\\nresults of a study in which 7-month-old monolingual and bilingual\\ninfants learned a head-turn response to a cue to obtain a visual\\nreward and then had to replace that with a competing response for\\nthe same reward [131]. Again, only the bilingual infants could learn\\nthe new response. Even before children have productive language\\nability, the experience of building two distinct representational\\nsystems endows them with greater perceptual and attentional\\nresources than their monolingual peers. In light of such evidence\\nfor bilingual advantages in the first year of life, explanations for the\\nmechanism responsible for the advantages found later may need to\\nbe reconsidered to include a role for such perceptual processes.\\n\\nchallenged by evidence from preverbal infants who demonstrate early effects of bilingualism but for whom language inhibition is not a plausible explanation (Box 1).\\nAn alternative to inhibition is to consider the demands\\nimposed by a mixed set of congruent and incongruent\\ntrials: there is always some probability that the next\\ndisplay may be an incongruent trial. Thus, even on congruent trials the display must be evaluated before the\\nparticipant commits to a response. Congruent responses\\nwill typically be faster than incongruent responses, but\\nindividuals with superior attentional control processes\\n(e.g. bilinguals) will be able to carry out such evaluative\\ndecisions more rapidly and effectively. Therefore, a different account of the bilingual advantage is in terms of conflict\\nmonitoring [39,81,82]. Evidence supporting this view\\ncomes from situations in which monitoring demands are\\nlow \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if the majority of trials are of one type only [80,81],\\nthe potentially misleading information (spatial position in\\nthe Simon task, flanker items in the flanker paradigm) can\\nbe treated as a valid cue, even if the participant must\\nrespond in the direction opposite to that indicated by the\\ncue. In such low-monitoring conditions the bilingual advantage is typically not found. More generally, Herna\\xc2\\xb4ndez,\\n245\\n\\n\\x0cReview\\nCosta, and Humphreys [112] argue for a bilingual advantage in the deployment of attention, enabling them to resist\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98capture\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by irrelevant information; such differences in\\nattentional control may be the consequence of superior\\nconflict monitoring. Conflict monitoring and inhibition\\nare not mutually exclusive: although monitoring is consistent with evidence that pure blocks of congruent trials are\\nperformed equivalently by monolinguals and bilinguals\\n[102,113], an inhibition account is still required to explain\\nevidence that pure blocks of incongruent trials are sometimes performed faster by bilinguals, notably by older\\nadults for whom the task is more effortful [102].\\nAnother problem with a pure inhibition account is that\\nbilingual advantages are only found with some types of\\ninhibition. The relevant distinction is captured by the\\ncontrast between the concepts of \\xe2\\x80\\x98response inhibition\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nand \\xe2\\x80\\x98interference suppression\\xe2\\x80\\x99 [75,114]. In response inhibition, a univalent stimulus is associated with a prepotent\\nresponse that must be overruled, such as say \\xe2\\x80\\x98day\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to a\\npicture of night or press \\xe2\\x80\\x98left\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when the arrow points right.\\nBilinguals typically show no advantage in these situations\\n[75,103]. In interference suppression, a bivalent stimulus\\ncontains two cues, each associated with a different response, such as the word \\xe2\\x80\\x98red\\xe2\\x80\\x99 written in blue ink, so\\nattention must be selectively focused on the relevant\\ncue. Bilinguals typically outperform monolinguals on these\\ntasks [21]. The hallmark of univalent response inhibition\\ntasks is that the correct response can be pre-programmed\\nbefore the cuing stimulus appears (e.g. \\xe2\\x80\\x98if sun appears I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\nsay \\xe2\\x80\\x98night\\xe2\\x80\\x99; \\xe2\\x80\\x98if the arrow points right I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll respond left\\xe2\\x80\\x99). On\\nbivalent tasks, in contrast, the nature of the interfering\\ninformation is not revealed until the display appears; for\\nexample, in the Simon task the participant prepares to\\nrespond on the left if the stimulus is green, but cannot\\nprepare to deal with possible competing information until\\nthe display is shown. Bilinguals are more efficient at\\ndealing with this online interference, in much the same\\nway as the picture of a horse presented to a French/English\\nbilingual would evoke both \\xe2\\x80\\x98horse\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98cheval\\xe2\\x80\\x99, one of\\nwhich must be suppressed. In a sense, the bilingual must\\nconstantly maintain the set of \\xe2\\x80\\x98respond in one language,\\nsuppress the other language\\xe2\\x80\\x99 whenever the possibility of\\ntwo languages exists (cf. global inhibition). Further, this\\nset maintenance must coexist with processing the stimuli\\nand responses of the language currently utilized in a fluent\\nand appropriate manner (cf. local inhibition). Thus, language use for bilinguals involves interference suppression,\\nand the online monitoring required in both non-verbal task\\nswitching and language selection is similar.\\nThe suggestion that bilinguals are particularly adept at\\nmaintaining the appropriate one of two (or more) relevant\\ntask goals or attentional sets in working memory has much\\nin common with the notion of selection of wanted stimuli as\\nopposed to inhibition of unwanted ones. The net effect is\\nthe same, but by this view the suppression of potentially\\ninterfering information is essentially a consequence of\\nactive selection of the relevant information, rather than\\na primary mechanism of direct inhibition. This view is\\nconsistent with that proposed by Colzato and colleagues\\n[77], who concluded that the bilingual advantage is not due\\nto the constant exercise of inhibition, but that learning to\\n246\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences April 2012, Vol. 16, No. 4\\n\\nkeep two languages separate leads to an improvement in\\nselecting goal-relevant information from goal-irrelevant\\ninformation.\\nThe sum of the evidence places the bilingual advantage\\nbeyond the explanatory power of a single process, a simple\\nneural network, or a single executive control component.\\nInstead, the ongoing experience of monitoring two languages, in conjunction with the need to monitor context,\\nspeaker, and other environmental cues while inhibiting\\nattention to the currently unused but active language\\nmodifies how the mind and brain engage in ordinary\\nconversation for bilinguals. The more effortful any of these\\ncomponents become, the more likely it is for bilingual\\nadvantages to emerge on non-verbal tasks. However, the\\nimpact of this modification may be seen most clearly on\\ntasks that bear the closest resemblance to bilingual language use, such as task switching. In this case, it is easy to\\nsee how the task of attending to the shape of a stimulus\\ninstead of its color resembles the task of retrieving the\\nname for an object in French instead of in English. Not\\nsurprisingly, these tasks are typically performed better by\\nbilinguals than by monolinguals, although the details of\\nthose performances are not yet well understood: some\\nstudies report bilingual advantages on mixing costs indicating set shifting [82,102], whereas others report the\\nadvantage in local switch costs indicating response switching [76,115]. More generally, it is important to point out\\nthat bilingual advantages are not always found, even on\\ntasks for which such performance differences would be\\nexpected. Some of the conditions that support the appearance of a bilingual advantage have been discussed, such as\\nthe need for monitoring and difficulty of the conditions, but\\nothers are still unknown. Another factor in determining\\nperformance outcomes is probably the nature or degree of\\nbilingualism in the participants (Box 2). More details about\\nthe specific tasks and precise language histories of the\\nbilingual participants may resolve these differences.\\nBilingualism and dementia\\nThe finding that bilingualism enhances cognitive control\\nraises the possibility that lifelong bilingualism protects\\nagainst age-related cognitive decline, and may even postpone the onset of symptoms of dementia. In this case,\\nbilingualism may be one of the environmental factors that\\ncontribute to cognitive reserve or brain reserve [116].\\nCognitive reserve is the idea that engagement in stimulating physical or mental activity can act to maintain\\ncognitive functioning in healthy aging and postpone the\\nonset of symptoms in those suffering from dementia.\\nThese factors include education, occupational status,\\nhigher socio-economic class, and the continuing involvement in physical, intellectual and social activities [117\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n119]. If bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve, then\\nbilinguals should maintain higher levels of cognitive functioning and cope better with symptoms of dementia than\\nmonolinguals who are otherwise equivalent.\\nTo test this idea, Bialystok, Craik, and Freedman [120]\\nexamined the hospital records of monolingual and bilingual patients who had been diagnosed with various types of\\ndementia. In spite of being equivalent on a variety of\\ncognitive and other factors, the bilinguals experienced\\n\\n\\x0cReview\\n\\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences April 2012, Vol. 16, No. 4\\n\\nBox 2. How bilingual?\\n\\nBox 3. Outstanding questions\\n\\nBilingualism is not a categorical experience but experimental\\nresearch designs require it be treated as such \\xe2\\x80\\x93 participants are\\nmonolingual or bilingual and differences in performance are assessed\\nfor members of the two groups. However, individuals can never be\\nperfectly monolingual or bilingual: even the most monolingual\\npeople have had some experience with another language, for\\nexample as a school subject or a travel necessity, and all bilinguals\\nhave preferred languages or preferred contexts for each. These\\ngradations raise three questions about the research results.\\nThe first question is the possibility of a cumulative benefit for\\nmultiple languages. If managing two languages enhances cognitive\\ncontrol processes, then does further enhancement accrue from the\\nmanagement of three or more languages, as explicitly proposed by\\nDiamond [132]? Research by Chertkow et al. [119] on Alzheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndisease and Kave\\xc2\\xb4 et al. [123] on normal aging showed better\\noutcomes for multilinguals than for bilinguals, but there may be\\nsignificant differences between multilinguals and bilinguals that do\\nnot exist between bilinguals and monolinguals. As we have\\nsuggested, bilinguals are typically not pre-selected for talent or\\ninterest but multilinguals may often be individuals with high ability\\nand motivation to learn other languages, factors which may impact\\nas well on cognitive performance.\\nThe second question is the degree of bilingualism required for\\nthese benefits to emerge. If bilingualism is protective against some\\nforms of dementia, then middle-aged people will want to know\\nwhether it is too late to learn another language, or whether their\\nhigh-school French will count towards cognitive reserve. A related\\nquestion concerns the age of acquisition of a second language: is\\nearlier better? The best answer at present is that early age of\\nacquisition, overall fluency, frequency of use, levels of literacy and\\ngrammatical accuracy all contribute to the bilingual advantage, with\\nno single factor being decisive [133] (Gigi Luk, PhD thesis, York\\nUniversity, Canada, 2008). Increasing bilingualism leads to increasing modification of cognitive outcomes.\\nFinally, if the benefits of bilingualism are at least partly explained\\nby the joint activation of two languages, does the similarity of the\\ntwo languages matter? Does Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilingualism require\\nmore (or less?) attentional control to maintain separation than say\\nChinese\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilingualism? In a study with children who spoke\\nEnglish plus one of French, Spanish, or Chinese, there was no effect\\nof the type of bilingualism, and all bilingual children outperformed\\nmonolingual children on tests of executive control [134].\\n\\n\\x0f Nature of the bilingual advantage: what are the limits and\\nboundary conditions for the bilingual advantage and why are\\nbilingual advantages not always found? What is the role of the\\nstandard components of executive control \\xe2\\x80\\x93 inhibition, shifting,\\nand working memory \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in bilingual differences in processing? Do\\nthese relations change over the lifespan?\\n\\x0f Cognitive reserve: is the bilingual protection against cognitive\\ndecline similar to other types of cognitive reserve in terms of\\nmechanism and neural correlates?\\n\\x0f Brain correlates: what changes occur in the frontal lobes? Are\\nthere effects on other brain regions?

Does bilingualism have\\ndifferential effects on various types of dementia?\\n\\nonset symptoms and were diagnosed approximately 3\\xe2\\x80\\x934\\nyears later than the monolinguals. Specifically, monolingual patients were diagnosed on average at age 75.4 years\\nand bilinguals at age 78.6. A replication from a new set of\\npatients all diagnosed with probable Alzheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disease\\n(AD) [121] confirmed the results.\\nThree questions about these results are their reliability,\\nvalidity, and causality. For reliability, several studies have\\nreplicated these findings. Chertkow et al. [122] reported\\npartial support for the original results and showed that\\nmultilinguals were diagnosed with AD later than comparable monolinguals, although a more limited effect was\\nfound when monolinguals were compared with bilinguals.\\nA similar positive relationship between multilingualism\\nand high-level cognitive functioning was reported by Kave\\xc2\\xb4\\net al. [123] in a study of elderly Israelis. Gollan et al. [124]\\nreported a study with Spanish\\xe2\\x80\\x93English bilinguals who had\\nbeen diagnosed with probable AD and found that a higher\\ndegree of bilingualism was associated with later age of\\nonset and diagnosis, although only in the less-educated\\npatients. (See Box 3 for further outstanding questions.)\\nSecond, validity requires demonstrating the specific\\nrelation between the predictor and outcome variables.\\n\\nPreviously, socioeconomic status, cultural differences\\nand immigration status have been suggested as contributors to or even causes of the bilingual advantage. However,\\nin both Toronto studies, educational level and occupational\\nstatus favored the monolingual group and immigration\\nstatus was ruled out as a contributing factor.\\nThird, regarding cause and effect, is it possible that\\npeople with \\xe2\\x80\\x98good brains\\xe2\\x80\\x99 are both resistant to dementia\\nand also more likely to learn a second language? This is\\nunlikely: most people do not become bilingual because they\\nare bright or have a flair for learning languages, but rather\\nout of necessity. Supporting this interpretation, a recent\\nstudy showed that in a sample of monolingual and bilingual AD patients matched on age, cognitive level, and other\\nfactors, CT scans showed more AD pathology in the brains\\nof the bilinguals, consistent with the idea that they are\\nbetter able to cope with the disease and can function longer\\nwithout showing symptoms [125].\\nConcluding remarks\\nIn the first study reporting the surprising outcome of an\\nadvantage in cognitive and linguistic performance by bilingual children, Peal and Lambert concluded: \\xe2\\x80\\x98Intellectually [the bilingual child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] experience with two language\\nsystems seems to have left him with a mental flexibility, a\\nsuperiority in concept formation, a more diversified set of\\nmental abilities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ([9], p. 20). Peal and Lambert did not\\nexplain what they meant by \\xe2\\x80\\x98mental flexibility\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but the\\ndescription works well to describe the data accumulated in\\nthe 50 years since their original study. Bilinguals do\\nsometimes have an advantage in inhibition, but they also\\nhave an advantage in selection; bilinguals do sometimes\\nhave an advantage in switching, but they also have an\\nadvantage in sustaining attention; and bilinguals do sometimes have an advantage in working memory, but they also\\nhave an advantage in representation and retrieval. Together, this pattern sounds like \\xe2\\x80\\x98mental flexibility\\xe2\\x80\\x99, the\\nability to adapt to ongoing changes and process information efficiently and adaptively.\\nIt should not be surprising that intense and sustained\\nexperience leaves its mark on our minds and brains \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the\\nfunctional connections that come from practice are surely\\nchanged by massive experience, and the structural regions\\nthat are recruited for specific activities undoubtedly\\nchange as well through use. These responses to experience\\n247\\n\\n\\x0cReview\\nare precisely what we mean by neuroplasticity. Yet, in the\\ncase of bilingualism, the assumption has long been that\\nany such effects would be deeply negative: as one influential educational researcher commented in 1926, \\xe2\\x80\\x98This\\nmight be considered evidence that the use of a foreign\\nlanguage in the home is one of the chief factors in producing mental retardation as measured by intelligence tests\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n([126], p. 393). Almost a century later, and in the face of\\nsubstantial evidence to the contrary, there remains resistance to the idea that bilingualism can enhance aspects of\\ncognitive function. Educational and clinical practitioners\\nroutinely advise parents to \\xe2\\x80\\x98simplify\\xe2\\x80\\x99 their children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s linguistic environment when there are signs of academic\\nstruggle, and language professionals prescribe optimal\\ntimetables (and methods) for introducing languages to\\nchildren to minimize the inevitable confusion. But such\\nviews are based on fear and anecdote \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the weight of\\nscientific evidence supports the promise of \\xe2\\x80\\x98mental flexibility\\xe2\\x80\\x99. There is still much we do not know about the effect of\\nbilingualism on the mind, the neural correlates of those\\neffects, and the causal components of the experience that\\nlead to them. But it is too late to turn back: it is now clear\\nthat the bilingual mind has been uniquely shaped by\\nexperience.\\nAcknowledgments\\nPreparation of this manuscript was supported by grant R01HD052523\\nfrom the US National Institutes of Health and grant A2559 from the\\nNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to E.B.;\\ngrant A8261 from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\\nCouncil of Canada to F.I.M.C.; and grant MOP57842 from the\\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research to E.B. and F.I.M.C.
